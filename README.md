# University Projects – Data Science & Business Analytics

This repository collects selected projects completed during the Master’s program in Data Science and Business Analytics at the University of Warsaw. Each project applies data science and machine learning techniques to real-world datasets, covering a wide range of analytical and computational methods.

# Projects 
1. [Web scraping & Analysis of perfume data](https://github.com/julia-martyniuk/perfume_scraping)
Web scraping project focused on women’s fragrances. Built dataset with Selenium, analyzed pricing patterns and fragrance attributes.
2. [Predicting apartment prices](https://github.com/julia-martyniuk/apartment_price_regression) 
Machine Learning project applying multiple algorithms to model and predict apartment prices. Includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and comparison.
3. [Personal Scheduler](https://github.com/julia-martyniuk/personal_scheduler)
Group project completed by Yuliya Martyniuk, Zahra Eshtiaghi and Tseeltuul Erdenebat as a final project for the course "Advanced Programming in R". Personal Scheduler is a Shiny web application designed to help students (and others) manage deadlines and monitor academic workload over time.
4. [Clustering metrics evaluation on images](https://rpubs.com/Yuliya_Martyniuk/1340798)
This research evaluates the effectiveness and consistency of three clustering evaluation metrics by applying them to images with distinct visual and structural properties — a complex mural, a photo of pierogi, and a Baltic Sea view — and analyzing both metric results and visual segmentations to identify performance patterns and conditions favoring specific methods.
5. [Uber trips clustering & time analysis](https://rpubs.com/Yuliya_Martyniuk/1341142)
This task involves clustering Uber trip data by location, analyzing cluster centers over time and date.
6. [PCA on coffee quality data](https://rpubs.com/Yuliya_Martyniuk/1340793)
This project applies Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the coffee quality dataset as an effective dimensionality reduction technique for analyzing high-dimensional data, preserving key information, and enabling visualization beyond two dimensions.
7. [Dimensionality reduction of World Bank Indicators](https://rpubs.com/Yuliya_Martyniuk/1341112)
This project applies PCA and t-SNE to World Bank Development Indicators (2021) to reveal global economic patterns and local country clusters.
8. [Association rule mining on health data](https://rpubs.com/Yuliya_Martyniuk/1340785)
This project applies association rule mining to analyze relationships between symptoms and diseases, treating symptoms as both antecedents and consequents, while also addressing specific personal symptom-related questions.
9. [Income perception patterns in the European social survey](https://rpubs.com/Yuliya_Martyniuk/1340800)
This project is aimed to search the patterns across European Social Survey, especially focusing on “Feeling about household’s income nowadays” variable as a rule consequent.

(More projects to be added as the program progresses.)
